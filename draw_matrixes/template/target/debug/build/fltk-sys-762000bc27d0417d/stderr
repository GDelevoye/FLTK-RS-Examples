CMake Deprecation Warning at fltk/CMakeLists.txt:37 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0072 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.




CMake Warning:
  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:

    CMAKE_ASM_FLAGS
    CMAKE_ASM_FLAGS_RELEASE
    CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS
    OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE
